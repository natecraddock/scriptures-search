                    "I think there is a verse that talks about that... Alma... ummm.. I think it's chapter 11? It mentions the resurrection...
                    Something like even hair will be restored..."
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    We have all been there, a verse is just right there on the tip of your tongue but you just can't remember where to find it.
                    This tool intends to help in that situation. A quick search for "hair, restore" in the <strong>Keyword Search</strong> mode
                    finds 3 verses in the standard works, with Alma 11:44 as the verse you were thinking of.
                    <a href="../?mode=keyword&query=hair,restore">See this search</a>
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Now, this tool isn't unique, the Gospel Library app and Church website allow a search of the standard works, and their search
                    abilities have improved in recent years. Scriptures Search does contain a few settings and features that set it apart, namely
                    the footnotes and similar verses tools. See the <a href="./about/">About</a> page for more information about how this app came
                    to be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It allows a very fast and simple plaintext search of the standard works. I also have included some fun features
                    to visualize data in the standard works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Everything on this app runs on your device. Once the page (and related files) have been requested,
                    no information is sent to my server. I don't store cookies, I don't need user accounts. This is meant to
                    help people and I don't need any of that information. I do make use of <em>local storage</em> which is a browser
                    feature to allow me to store plaintext on your device. Many websites do this. I use local storage to store your
                    preferences. This allows me to "remember" which mode and settings you used last. If you clear your browser data,
                    these settings will be lost.
