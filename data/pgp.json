I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.",

In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature.
