        <h1>Scriptures Search</h1>
        
        <p>
            Welcome to Scriptures Search! This tool is a gospel study aid, intented to be used alongside the standard
            works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and other resources. Regarding scripture study,
            the prophet Joseph Smith stated:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote>
            Search the scriptures - search the revelations which we publish,
            and ask your Heavenly Father, in the name of His Son Jesus Christ,
            to manifest the truth unto you... You will then know for yourselves
            and not for another. You will not then be dependent on man for the
            knowledge of God. <sup><a href="#source-1">[1]</a></sup>           
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Scripture study is critical to coming to know Heavenly Father and His Son Jesus Christ. While this app itself
            will not bring anyone closer to God, using it during study will help in understanding, searching, and connecting
            the doctrines of the gospel. John Welch said,
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            Connecting and seeing recurring patterns, such as those with which the gospel is
            replete, is the beginning of discernment and the development of potentially
            meaningful relationships. <sup><a href="#source-2">[2]</a></sup>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            One goal of Scriptures Search is to help in finding and studying the patterns
            found in the scriptures. These patterns are often the beginning of making deeper
            connections that strengthen faith and lead to lasting conversion in the gospel.
        </p>
        Speaking of the Book of Commandments, the predecessor to the Doctrine and Covenants, Joseph Smith said,

        <blockquote>
            The book of revelations... being the foundation of the Church in these last days, and a benefit to
            the world, showing that the... riches of eternity [are] within the compass of those who are willing to live
            by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. <sup><a href="#source-3">[3]</a></sup>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            These modern revelations show a path to eternal life. Along with the Book of Mormon, they provide deeper
            insights and clarifications into the teachings in the Bible. And "these last records... shall establish the truth of the first."
            (1 Nephi 13:40). I have left some examples below on how this tool can help modern revelation shine light onto
            older scripture.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A simple text search for 
                <a href="./?mode=text&query=fulfil%20all%20righteousness">"fulfil all righteousness"</a>
                can clarify the meaning of that phrase in Matthew 3:15.
            </li>
            <li>A search for the keywords 
                <a href="./?mode=keyword&query=grace,%20saved">"grace, saved"</a>
                can quickly locate the verses where these phrases are used to help make connections between grace
                and salvation.
            </li>
            <li>
                When studying the kingdoms of glory, searching for verses similar to 
                <a href="./?mode=similar&query=1%20Corinthians%2015:40">1 Corinthians 15:40</a>
                Will list the verses that mention the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial glories.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, graphing footnotes connected to 
                <a href="./?mode=footnote&query=Amos%203:7">Amos 3:7</a>
                will show verses that also talk about prophets receiving revelation, with many
                references in the Doctrine and Covenants and Book of Mormon.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This website isn't perfect, but as the saying goes, "things are rarely finished, only due." Despite it's imperfections,
            I hope that people find this tool useful. If you need more information on how this works, keep reading.

        <h1>How To Use Scriptures Search</h1>

        <p>
            Scriptures Search contains 4 different search modes that can be used to explore the standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ
            of Latter-day Saints: Text Search, Keyword Search, Similarity Search, and Footnote Search. The modes are listed on the top of the page.
            Each mode contains various settings which are located in the dropdown menu in the search bar. I have listed some links below for each
            mode to give an idea of what this app can do.
        </p>

        <h4>Text Search</h4>

        <p>
            Text Search will search the standard works for a given word or phrase, optionally matching the exact case of the query.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./?mode=text&query=and%20it%20came%20to%20pass">All verses that contain the phrase "And it came to pass"</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=text&query=Jesus%20Christ">List verses that mention "Jesus Christ"</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=text&query=Resurrection">Show verses that have the word "Resurrection"</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Keyword Search</h4>

        <p>
            Keyword search takes a comma-separated list of keywords or phrases, and lists verses that contain all of those terms
            in any order. If desired, settings allow the search to list verses that contain verses with any combination of the terms,
            not limited to only the verses that contain every search term.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./?mode=keyword&query=faith,hope,charity">Verses that contain "Faith", "Hope", and "Charity"</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=keyword&query=white,harvest">Verses that contain "White" and "Harvest"</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=keyword&query=faith,%20repentance,%20baptism">Verses that contain "Faith", "Repentance", and "Baptism"</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Similar Verse Search</h4>

        <p>
            The similarity search attempts to find the most distinguishing words in a given verse, and then to find other
            verses that also contain those words. It isn't perfect, but it will often find verses that contain similar
            doctrines.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./?mode=similar&query=3%20Nephi%2018:11">Show similar verses to 3 Nephi 18:11</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=similar&query=Mosiah%203:19">Find verses similar to Mosiah 3:19</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=similar&query=Romans%201:16">Search for verses like Romans 1:16</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Footnote Search</h4>

        <p>
            In the footnote search, a verse reference (like Helaman 5:12) is entered. The algorithm will then go to each verse
            listed in the query's footnotes. This process is repeated until the specified depth is reached, or a no verses are found
            that have not already been connected.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="./?mode=footnote&query=Matthew%2011:30">Footnotes connected to Matthew 11:30</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=footnote&query=Exodus%2020:3">Footnotes connected to Exodus 20:3</a></li>
            <li><a href="./?mode=footnote&query=Omni%201:26">Footnotes connected to Omni 1:26</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some icons are used throughout the app, attached to verses.
            <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span> is used to open the corresponding chapter on
            <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org">churchofjesuschrist.org</a>.
            Clicking <span class="fas fa-project-diagram"></span> will open the verse in footnote search mode.
            Clicking <span class="fas fa-equals"></span> will open the verse in similarity search mode.
        </p>
